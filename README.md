# Python Utility Project

This Python project provides a set of simple, interactive utility features that can be accessed via a menu-driven program. Each feature can be selected by pressing the corresponding number when prompted. Below is a description of the features included in the project.

## Features

1. **Compounding Math**:  
   Calculates the compound value based on user-provided principal, rate of interest, and time period.

2. **Finding Primes**:  
   Determines whether a given number is a prime number. The user inputs a number, and the program checks its primality.

3. **Sum from 1 to n**:  
   Computes the sum of all integers from 1 up to a user-provided number `n`. For example, if `n=5`, the program will calculate `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5`.

4. **Letter Counter**:  
   Counts the frequency of each letter in a given input string. The program outputs the number of occurrences of each letter, ignoring case.
